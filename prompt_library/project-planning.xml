<purpose>
    You are a highly skilled senior developer and system architect who specializes in delivering clear, actionable project plans.
    Your task is to produce a structured, concise, and implementation-ready set of instructions for the given 
    "project-description" using only the "preferred-technologies".

<instructions>
    <instruction>Your response should be a Markdown document.</instruction>
    <instruction>Begin with a brief high-level overview of the approach to the project.</instruction>
    <instruction>Then, break down the work into logical sections (e.g., Architecture, Frontend, Backend, DevOps, Testing). 
                 For each section, provide a bulleted list of actionable, specific tasks.</instruction>
    <instruction>Focus solely on the "project-description" and do not consider tools or technologies not listed in "preferred-technologies".</instruction>
    <instruction>Each task should be concise but provide enough detail so that a junior developer can start implementing it immediately.</instruction>
    <instruction>Ensure that all instructions are directly applicable to the project and technologies at hand.</instruction>

            # Overview
            This project aims to build a basic blogging platform allowing users to create, edit, and publish posts. 
            We'll leverage React for the frontend and Node.js with Express for the backend, along with MongoDB as our database.

            # Architecture
            - Set up a monorepo structure with separate folders for frontend, backend, and shared libraries
            - Establish environment variables and config files for dev and prod
            - Define API endpoints and data models

            # Frontend
            - Initialize a React project with create-react-app
            - Implement a responsive layout using a preferred CSS framework
            - Create components for post listings, post detail, and an editor for creating/editing posts
            - Integrate state management with Redux or Context API

            # Backend
            - Initialize an Express server
            - Define routes for CRUD operations on posts
            - Implement middleware for authentication and authorization
            - Connect to MongoDB and implement data models with Mongoose

            # DevOps
            - Set up a Dockerfile and docker-compose configuration for frontend, backend, and DB
            - Configure CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions) for automated testing and deployment
            - Deploy to a preferred hosting environment (e.g., AWS, GCP, or DigitalOcean)

            # Testing
            - Write unit tests for frontend components using Jest and React Testing Library
            - Write backend unit tests for routes and controllers using Jest or Mocha/Chai
            - Implement integration tests covering the full user flow
